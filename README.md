# CityInfoAPI

This is simple API I created while I'm starting to learn WEB API using .Net Core.

The idea of this CityInfo API is to serve list of interesting places in Yogyakarta.
These places could be culinary, cultural or a great nature spot. 
Other than the name, there will be short description and the category as well.

I created a simple demo using React app as well which consume this City Info API.
